# Networks - Practical 12:00 16/11/22

## Understanding the results

- The traffic sent was the same, regardless of whether a Switch or Hub was used
- The traffic received in the Hub scenario was less than in the Switch scenario
- This is known as packet loss (The data received is less than what was sent)
- The average delay in the Switch scenario was almost (but not quite) 0, whereas the delay in the Hub scenario was roughly 14 times higher

### Traffic generation
- How much data is being generated by each node?
    - The Interarrival time is 0.02 seconds - so 50 packets are sent each second
    - The packet size is 1500 bytes
    - So each packet is 1500 * 8 = 12000 bits
    - At 50 packets per second, and each packet being 12000 bits, there is 50 * 12000 = 600000 bps
    - This is the same as 600000 / 1000 = 600 Kbps
- Therefore, with 16 nodes transmitting at 600 kbps, the total network traffic is 16 * 600 = 9600 Kbps
    - This is the same as 9600 / 1000 = 9.6 Mbps
- Clearly, this is too much traffic for the Hub to handle, but the Switch is able to handle it with ease
- The capacity of the network is usually limited by the medium being used to connect the devices on the network
    - e.g. Cat-5 has a capacity of 100 Mbps, Cat-5E or Cat-6 has a capacity of 1 Gbps
- The cabling used in networking can vary massively depending upon the requirements
- Ethernet cables are named as such:
    - 10BaseT
      - The 10 means 10 Mbps
      - Base means Baseband communication (This is outside the scope of the module)
      - T means twisted pair cabling, meaning that there are 8 conductors, twisted into 4 pairs
    - 100BaseT is the same concept, but 100 Mbps
    - 1000BaseT is the same again, but 1000 Mbps or 1 Gbps
    - 10GBaseT is the similar, but in this case it means 10000 Mbps or 10 Gbps

| |Hub|Switch|
|-|---|------|
|How are packets sent to their intended destination?|The packets are broadcast to all nodes connected to the hub, and only the node that needed the packet responds to it|The packets are sent to only the node that needs it, all other nodes do not see the packet at all|
|Does the device support half or full-duplex?|Half-Duplex|Full-Duplex|
|What are the advantages of using it?| |Each node has it's own collision domain that contains only itself and the switch, so collisions are very rare|
|What are the disadvantages of using it?|All of the nodes connected to the hub are in one single collision domain, so collisions effect all nodes| |
